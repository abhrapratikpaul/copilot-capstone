# User Story

## Description

As a user,
I want to manage my tasks through a simple web interface,
SO THAT I can track my to-do items and mark them as complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary requirements

1. Given the task page is open, when the page loads, then existing tasks are displayed in a list.
2. Given the task input field is visible, when the user enters a task name and clicks "Add Task", then the task is saved and appears in the list.
3. Given a task exists, when the user clicks the checkbox next to it, then the task is marked as complete with strikethrough styling.
4. Given a task exists, when the user clicks the "Delete" button, then the task is removed from the list.
5. Given the task input is empty, when the user clicks "Add Task", then an error message displays stating "Task name is required".

### Additional requirements

1. Given tasks exist, when the page loads, then completed tasks appear at the bottom of the list.
2. Given tasks exist, when the user clicks "Clear Completed", then all completed tasks are removed.

## Clarifications / Constraints

- Single-page web application (Python backend + HTML/JS frontend).
- No authentication required.
- Data persistence via local file or in-memory storage (no external database required).
